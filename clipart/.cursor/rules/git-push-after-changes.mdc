# Auto-push all changes to GitHub

After making ANY file changes (create, edit, delete), immediately push to git:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "описательное сообщение о сделанных изменениях"
git push
```

Rules:
- Do this after EVERY set of changes, without asking the user
- Commit message should be concise and describe what was changed (in Russian)
- Always use `git add -A` to include all changes
- Push to the current branch (typically `main`)
- If push fails, report the error to the user
- Do NOT skip this step — the user expects all changes to appear on GitHub immediately
